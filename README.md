# Vacancy Parser

This project is a job vacancy parser from popular job platforms. It collects job listings, analyzes them, and filters them based on specified parameters. In the future, the parser will support notifications to users about new job openings that match their preferences.

The project provides an API that allows users to search for job vacancies based on parameters such as salary, experience, and required technologies.
